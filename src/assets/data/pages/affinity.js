    text: "Using a Microsoft Kinect camera, its depth data, and Unity graphics, we created 3D renderings of individual body shapes. By mapping motion data to a mesh and 3D point cloud, users can visualize their physical beings in a novel way. "+
    "These renderings can use biometric data points from the user's physiology, which are gathered through Arduino sensors built into a custom glove. This data may influence the colors, patterns, visuals and sequences within the animations. " +
    "The physical space is a large, open room â€” however, the digital space is much smaller, bound by digital walls to create a sense of affinity. Within these walls you may find objects to interact with, or find new ways to interact with each other."

    heading: "Conclusion",
    text: "Prospectively, the areas explored by this installation remain interesting. The visualization of biometrics, fostering a higher degree of physical awareness in digital spaces, and the dynamics between the physical and virtual may offer more opportunities for creating novel, playful, and cooperative human-computer interactions."
