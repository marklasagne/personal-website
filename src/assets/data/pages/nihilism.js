Nihilism is a journey into these feelings, albeit uncomfortable, it can also be a moment of reflection. The themes and effects of this experience are inspired by Huntington's Disease, reflecting the life someone with this disease may experience."

      text1: "During an individual's experience, they will have either sixty or thirty seconds until their image turns into static, blurring out their form and face. This indicates that they have either turned into nothing or died. The chance to 'live' for sixty seconds, or twice as long, is fifty percent, the same chance a child may inherit Huntington's disease if one of their parents is sick. The image always faces the user, and when the user turns their face away, their reflected image slowly rotates back forward. This is inspired by the feeling of noticing small things such as behaviors that indicate symptoms, but because the user is looking away, they are not certain what's happening, and it is much more noticeable to bystanders. Smiling causes the image to become chaotic with glitches, and depressing quotes flash on the screen, reminding the user not to be too happy. Other noise is generated from Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton in which cells or pixels are removed over time based on neighboring cell health. In this case, as time persists, more of the image will disappear, making the user's form less and less visible."
