The chance to 'live' for 60 seconds is 50%, like the chance of inheriting Huntington's disease from a sick parent. The image always faces the user, and turning away causes it to slowly rotate back. Smiling causes glitches and depressing quotes appear, while noise from Conway's Game of Life removes pixels over time, making the user's form less visible. ",
